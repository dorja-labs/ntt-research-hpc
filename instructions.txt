NTT Research Infrastructure Setup

This directory contains the Terraform configuration for the NTT Research infrastructure.
The infrastructure is organized into components, each with its own workspace.

Available Components:
- network: Base network infrastructure
- storage: Filestore instance for shared storage
- ood: Open OnDemand server
- hpc: HPC cluster
- k8s: Kubernetes cluster
- jupyter: Jupyter server

Usage:
1. Create a component:
   ./ctrl.sh create <component>

2. Delete a component:
   ./ctrl.sh delete <component>

3. List components:
   ./ctrl.sh list

Component Dependencies:
- storage depends on network
- ood depends on network and storage
- hpc/k8s/jupyter depend on network and storage

Notes:
- Each component has its own Terraform workspace
- Components are created in the correct order based on dependencies
- Use --force to overwrite existing components
- The network component requires special handling for deletion
